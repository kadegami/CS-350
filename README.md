# CS-350
Project Summary
This project involved programming the CC3220 microcontroller board to interact with and control peripherals using UART and GPIO interfaces. 
The main goal was to deepen understanding of embedded systems by directly working with hardware to process commands, control LEDs, and explore 
the functionalities of various peripherals. In essence, the project solved the challenge of creating reliable, low-level software that could efficiently 
manage peripheral interactions, highlighting the complexities and specifics of embedded programming.

Reflection
What did I do particularly well?
I was effective in understanding and utilizing the register maps to control peripherals, which required attention to detail and strong 
foundational knowledge in embedded systems. By leveraging this understanding, I was able to implement the project’s requirements while solving 
technical issues that arose, such as configuring the UART and setting up GPIOs.

Where could I improve?
My setup process could have been smoother; I ran into challenges locating files and troubleshooting errors due to configuration issues.
In future projects, I can improve by dedicating more time upfront to setting up my development environment and understanding the dependencies, 
as this would save troubleshooting time later.

What tools and/or resources am I adding to my support network?
Through this project, I’ve become more proficient with Code Composer Studio and the CC3220 documentation, both of which are valuable resources 
for embedded programming. Additionally, forums, technical documentation, and TI resources have proven to be essential for problem-solving and will be 
helpful for future projects.

What skills from this project are particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
Key transferable skills include low-level programming, peripheral interfacing, and debugging skills, which will be applicable in any future 
projects involving hardware control or embedded systems. Furthermore, the ability to analyze register maps and interpret technical documentation 
are highly useful skills for future work in both IoT and embedded systems domains.

How did I make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To ensure maintainability and readability, I kept my code modular, organized, and documented. By separating functions for each specific task and using 
clear comments, the project can be adapted for additional peripherals or configurations with minimal changes. I also maintained a clean folder structure, 
making it easy for others to follow the project setup, troubleshoot, and add new features as needed.
